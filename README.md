#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. It involves software product design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.
2. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
3. The development of programming languages such as Fortran and C.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
2. Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall. A scenario wil be building a financial software system for a bank where requirements are clearly defined and unlikely to change. One the other hand, Agile is a iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. A scenario will be developing a new e-commerce platform where customer needs and market conditions may change rapidly.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.  Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
2.  Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3.  Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. Examples are Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA. While Version Control Systems (VCS) are Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. For example, Git and Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some of the common challenges includes:
1. Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
2. Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
3. Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
   
Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 1. Unit testing involves testing individual components or modules of software.
 2. Integration testing involves the interactions between different components or subsystems.
 3. System testing has to do with the entire software system as a whole.
 4. Acceptance testing involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

Importance of Quality Control:Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.  The importance of prompt engineering in interacting with AI models is that it helps making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Tell me about Nigeria
Improved prompt: What is the history of Nigeria.
